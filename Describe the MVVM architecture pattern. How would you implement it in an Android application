MVVM stands for Model-View-ViewModel. It is an architectural pattern that helps separate the business logic from the UI code, making the codebase more modular, testable, 
and maintainable.

Model: Represents the data and business logic of the application. It is responsible for managing the data, which can come from a local database, network, or other sources.

View: Represents the UI layer. It displays data and routes user interactions to the ViewModel.

ViewModel: Acts as a bridge between the Model and the View. It holds the UI-related data and handles the communication between the View and Model. 
It also manages the lifecycle awareness of UI components.

In Android, MVVM can be implemented using ViewModel classes provided by the Android Architecture Components, LiveData for observable data, and Data Binding 
for updating the UI based on LiveData changes.
