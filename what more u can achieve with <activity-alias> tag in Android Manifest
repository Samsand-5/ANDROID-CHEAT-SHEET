1Ô∏è‚É£ What is <activity-alias>?
An activity alias basically refers to an alias or alternate entry point for an activity in an Android application. 
It allows you to create multiple entry points for the same activity by declaring in AndroidManifest.xml file using <activity-alias> tags.

2Ô∏è‚É£ How does it work?
When an intent matching the activity alias is received, it is directed to the target activity specified in the android:targetActivity attribute. 
The target activity can be any activity within your application, and it's typically the primary activity you want the alias to represent.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Why is it useful?
Activity aliases enable defining multiple "entry points" into your app, each with its own configuration, including icon and label. 
Think of it as creating different pathways for users to interact with your app.
Activity alias represents a symlink to an Activity.

Now, let's dive into some practical applications:

üîπ Dynamic App Icons:  Activity alias allows you to change the app icon at runtime when specific conditions are met. 
By dynamically changing the target activity of an alias, you can effectively change the icon and label associated 
with the app without requiring a full update or reinstall from the Google Play Store. 

üîπ Preserving Launcher Shortcuts: Ensure that changing the Launcher Activity doesn't result in the loss of shortcuts on the home screen. 
Activity aliases help preserve these launchers in Android.

üîπ Handling Intents and Deep Links: Create multiple entry points for your app, each configured to handle different intents or deep links. 
This enhances navigation and user experience.

üîπ Multi-Window Support: Another example of an important use case for activity aliases is in implementing multi-window support in Android apps.
For instance, a note-taking app could have activity aliases configured to handle different window configurations. 
One alias might be optimized for a full-screen experience, providing a rich editing interface with ample space for writing and formatting text.
Another alias could be designed specifically for multi-window mode, with a more compact layout that allows users to view their notes alongside other apps simultaneously.
