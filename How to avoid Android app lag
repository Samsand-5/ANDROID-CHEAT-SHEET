why the Android Apps lag which are as follows:
GC running frequently
Doing too much work on the main thread


Steps to be taken to improve the performance:

Do not allocate any object if it is not required. Do not allocate objects early, allocate objects only when it is required. Use lazy initialization.

Avoid Auto-Boxing as Integer, Boolean, etc takes more memory as classes like Integer takes more memory so use int where ever possible instead of Integer.

Use ArrayMap and SparseArray. Refer to this article, this will show why and when to use ArrayMap and SparseArray to optimize your Android Applications.

Use the concept of object pools to avoid memory churn. Learn about the bitmap pool.

Keep heavy work away from the main thread. Transfer it to the background thread.

Use static final for constants or const val in Kotlin.

Avoid Internal Getters/Setters wherever not necessary (direct field access is 3x faster)

Don't leak contexts in inner classes.

Use static inner classes over non-static.

Use LRU cache for the bitmap to avoid redundant decoding of bitmap, it reduces GC calling again and again.

Use StrictMode to find things you did by mistake like an accidental disk or network access or database query on the application's main thread in Android Development.

Use Profile GPU Rendering: It gives a quick visual representation of how much time it takes to render the frames of a UI window relative to the 16ms benchmark. 
You can enable it from Settings -> Developer Options -> Monitoring Section -> Select Profile GPU Rendering.

And finally, do not allocate a large number of unnecessary objects.
