LiveData component is an observable data holder class i.e, the contained value can be observed. 
LiveData is a lifecycle-aware component and thus it performs its functions according to the lifecycle state of other application components. 
Further, if the observer’s lifecycle state is active i.e., either STARTED or RESUMED, only then LiveData updates the app component. 
LiveData always checks the observer’s state before making any update to ensure that the observer must be active to receive it.
If the observer’s lifecycle state is destroyed, LiveData is capable of removing it, and thus it avoids memory leaks. 
It makes the task of data synchronization easier.

Advantages of LiveData component:

UI is updated as per the appropriate change in the data
It removes the stopped or destroyed activities which reduce the chance of app crash
No memory leaks as LiveData is a lifecycle-aware component.
