Data Refresh Strategies:

Pull-to-Refresh: Allow users to manually refresh data by pulling down on a list.

Periodic Syncing: Use WorkManager to schedule periodic background tasks to sync data with the server.

Network Availability: Automatically refresh data when the app detects a network connection after being offline.

Stale Data Check: Implement a mechanism to check the age of cached data and refresh it if itâ€™s stale.
