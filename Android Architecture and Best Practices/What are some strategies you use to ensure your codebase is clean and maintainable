Follow SOLID principles: Ensure each class has a single responsibility, use interfaces for abstraction, and apply design patterns where necessary.

Code Reviews: Regular code reviews help maintain code quality, catch potential issues early, and ensure consistency across the codebase.

Unit Testing and Test-Driven Development (TDD): Writing tests before or alongside code ensures that the functionality works as expected and helps catch regressions.

Refactoring: Regularly refactor code to improve readability and remove duplication, making it easier to maintain and extend.

Consistent Naming Conventions: Use consistent and meaningful naming conventions for variables, methods, and classes to make the code self-documenting.
