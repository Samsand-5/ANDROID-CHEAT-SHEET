Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows objects to receive their dependencies from an external source rather than creating them internally. 
This promotes code reusability, modularity, and easier testing. In Android, DI helps manage object creation and dependency resolution, especially when dealing with 
complex applications.

I have used both Dagger and Koin for DI. Dagger is a compile-time DI framework that ensures type safety and provides compile-time validation. 
Koin is a simpler, lightweight alternative that is easy to set up and use but performs dependency resolution at runtime.
In my projects, I use Dagger for larger projects requiring more robust, compile-time safety and Koin for smaller projects where setup time and ease of use are priorities.
