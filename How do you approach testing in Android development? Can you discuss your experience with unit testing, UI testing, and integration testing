Unit Testing: Write unit tests for individual components using frameworks like JUnit and Mockito. These tests focus on the business logic and ensure that individual functions 
behave as expected.

UI Testing: Use Espresso or UI Automator to perform UI testing. These tests simulate user interactions and verify that the UI behaves as expected.

Integration Testing: Test the interaction between different modules or layers (e.g., ViewModel and Repository). Integration tests help identify issues when components interact 
with each other.
