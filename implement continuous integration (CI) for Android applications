Implementing CI involves automating the process of building, testing, and deploying the application to ensure that code changes are continuously validated. 
My approach includes:

1) Setting up a CI server: Use tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions to set up a CI pipeline.
2) Automated Builds: Configure the CI pipeline to automatically build the project whenever code is pushed to the repository.
3) Running Tests: Integrate unit tests, integration tests, and UI tests into the CI pipeline to run automatically after each build.
