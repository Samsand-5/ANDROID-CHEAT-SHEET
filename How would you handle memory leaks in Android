Memory leaks in Android can occur when objects are held in memory even though they are no longer needed, typically due to improper management of references. 
To handle memory leaks, I would:

Use weak references for objects that may outlive their useful life (e.g., context in a long-running task).
Avoid inner classes or anonymous classes that hold implicit references to outer classes.
Use tools like Android Profiler and LeakCanary to detect and diagnose memory leaks.

Be mindful of lifecycle awareness in components. For example, using ViewModel to hold UI data ensures that the data persists across configuration changes without 
leaking the Activity context.
