Data Binding library is a support library that provides the feature of binding UI components in an activity/fragment to the data sources of the application. 
The library carries out this binding task in a declarative format and not in a programmatic way. 
Below is an example to understand the working of this library accurately:

To find a TextView widget and bind it to the userName property of the ViewModel variable, the findViewById() method is called:

TextView textView = findViewById(R.id.sample_text);

textView.setText(viewModel.getUserName());

After using the Data Binding library, the above code changes by using the assignment expression as follows:

<TextView

 android:text=”@{viewmodel.userName}” />

Advantages of Data Binding Component:

Make code simpler and easy to maintain by removing UI frameworks called in the activity.
Allows classes and methods to observe changes in data
Allows to make objects and fill which works as collection observables.
