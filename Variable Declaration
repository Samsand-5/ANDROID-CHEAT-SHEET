1) Use val for properties that should remain constant after initialization, promoting immutability and predictability.

2) Use var for properties that need to change their values over time, but be cautious about mutability.

3) Use const val for compile-time constants with fixed, known values.

4) Use lazy when you want to defer the initialization of properties that are expensive to compute and might not be used immediately.

5) Use lateinit for non-nullable properties that cannot be initialized immediately, such as when working with dependency injection frameworks.
