Coroutines are a feature in Kotlin that provide a way to handle asynchronous programming in a more straightforward and efficient manner compared to traditional threading. 
They allow you to write code in a sequential style while avoiding blocking the main thread. 
Coroutines work by suspending execution at specific points, which can then be resumed, allowing other tasks to run concurrently. 
They are lightweight and manage concurrency with much less overhead than threads.
I would use Coroutines in situations where I need to perform tasks like network calls, database operations, or any long-running tasks without blocking the main thread 
to keep the application responsive.
