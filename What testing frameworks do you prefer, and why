JUnit: I use JUnit for unit testing because it is the standard testing framework for Java and Kotlin. It is well-documented, widely adopted, and integrates seamlessly with Android.

Mockito: Mockito is my choice for mocking dependencies in unit tests. It allows for easy creation of mock objects and verification of interactions, 
making it ideal for testing classes in isolation.

Espresso: For UI testing, I prefer Espresso. It is designed specifically for Android UI testing and provides a rich API to interact with the UI elements,
ensuring that tests are reliable and maintainable.
