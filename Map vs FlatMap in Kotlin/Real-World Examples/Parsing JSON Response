Suppose you are working with an API response that contains a list of users, and each user has a list of hobbies. You want to extract all hobbies into a single list.

Using flatMap:

data class User(val name: String, val hobbies: List<String>)

fun main() {
    val users = listOf(
        User("Alice", listOf("Reading", "Hiking")),
        User("Bob", listOf("Gaming", "Cooking")),
        User("Charlie", listOf("Swimming", "Cycling"))
    )

    val allHobbies = users.flatMap { it.hobbies }

    println(allHobbies) // Output: [Reading, Hiking, Gaming, Cooking, Swimming, Cycling]
}

Here, flatMap flattens the nested structure of hobbies into a single list.
