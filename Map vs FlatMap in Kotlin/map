What is map?
The map function is used to transform each element in a collection into a new value by applying a given function. 
It returns a new collection where each element is the result of the transformation.

Syntax:
inline fun <T, R> Iterable<T>.map(transform: (T) -> R): List<R>

Example:
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
    val squaredNumbers = numbers.map { it * it }

    println(squaredNumbers) // Output: [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
}
Here, the map function transforms each number in the list into its square.
