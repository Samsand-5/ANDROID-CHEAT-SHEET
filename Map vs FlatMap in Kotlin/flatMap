What is flatMap?
The flatMap function is a combination of map and flatten. 
It applies a transformation function to each element of a collection and then flattens the resulting collections into a single collection.

Syntax:
inline fun <T, R> Iterable<T>.flatMap(transform: (T) -> Iterable<R>): List<R>

Example:
fun main() {
    val numbers = listOf(1, 2, 3)
    val multipliedLists = numbers.flatMap { num -> listOf(num, num * 2, num * 3) }

    println(multipliedLists) // Output: [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 6, 9]
}
In this example, flatMap transforms each number into a list of its multiples and then flattens those lists into a single list.
